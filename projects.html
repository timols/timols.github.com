    <h3>Spellwalrus</h3>

    <p class='no-indent'>
      Spellwalrus was an amusing work-related project focused on utilizing Twilio's fantastic voice telephony API. Not only did we write it in Python (+1) but we also found a fun way to be awoken in the mornings. Spellwalrus tests subscribers with a simple spelling question each morning to ascertain whether they're awake. We've decided to open source the fun, so you can find this project on github <a href="https://github.com/timols/spellwalrus">here</a>. Please feel free to fork it and play around. At one stage, we were thinking of charging people each time they failed to get the answer correct - as an added incentive to get people out of bed in the mornings. We then scrapped that idea because we weren't sure we could convince people to front money. I learnt three valuable things from this project:</p>
    <ol class='three-things'>
      <li>How to integrate effectively with an API</li>
      <li>How to structure a project</li>
      <li>People don't enjoy being awoken in the morning. They won't pay for it either.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>i-shop.com.au</h3>

    <p class='no-indent'>
      i-shop.com.au was a joint effort between two of my close friends and I. We wanted to bring e-commerce to a large number of retailers in and around Sydney because we found it incredibly frustrating that we weren't able to check the catalogues of neighboring boutique stores and shop around to find the best deal. We weren't fully committed to realizing this project and whilst I managed to exit at an opportune moment, the project itself did not succeed as we hoped. Our problem it turned out, wasn't the idea, but more the fact that we didn't spend enough time selling. We should have been selling selling selling. I learnt three valuable things from this project:
    </p>
    <ol class='three-things'>
      <li>Working with friends is hard - communication is key</li>
      <li>Business development is essential - always be selling</li>
      <li>Manage your own projects.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>After Dark</h3>

    <p class='no-indent'>
      After Dark was a collection of events held for under 18s in Sydney during the school holiday period that was marketed and promoted mostly online. It was created as a result of years of frustration as a teenager with nothing to do during the break. One of the key factors in our success was the targeted email marketing campaigns and our thorough understanding of our target market. Despite the fact that we decided to stop pursuing this after numerous events, we considered us ourselves to have been very successful. Our business development was excellent and we just never stopped selling selling selling. I learnt three valuable things from this project:
    </p>
    <ol class='three-things'>
      <li>Know where your target market spend their time online &amp; offline</li>
      <li>Let your customers know what you are doing and why you're doing it</li>
      <li>Give people something they really want, not just what you want.</li>
    </ol>
