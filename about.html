<h2>Hi there!</h2>

<p class="no-indent">
  I'm Tim and I like to get stuff done. I like learning new things and constantly challenging myself. I'm interested in technology, business, learning and getting stuff done.
</p>

<p class='no-indent'>
  Currently I get stuff done full-time for <a href="http://www.topguest.com">Topguest</a> where I'm working with <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">(Ruby on) Rails</a>, <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Python</a>, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
</p>

<p class='no-indent'>
  I like to wear many hats, and get my hands dirty getting stuff done. Whether that means I'm engineering, product managing, recruiting, selling, human managing or doing just about anything else, I'm getting stuff done. If you think I can help you get stuff done, <a href='/contact'>please get in touch</a>.
</p>

<p class="no-indent">
  I like to use a number of tools to help me get stuff done, which I highly recommend to anyone else looking to get things done:
