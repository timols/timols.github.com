title: Foursquare Merchant API Ruby Gem
---
<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>For those of you using the Foursquare API and providing services to businesses or merchants, you'll be happy to have a nice neat little wrapper for it written in ruby. I've released it today entitled <a href='https://github.com/timols/fourmer'><strong>fourmer</strong></a>.</p>

<p class='no-indent'>Fourmer makes it easy for you to create and manage campaigns on the Merchant API. Essentially, the interface attempts to mimic, as much as possible, the existing structure of the API, so you can simply create specials, venue groups, add venues, create campaigns and get stats back without having to write your own wrapper!</p>

<p class='no-indent'>This is a work in progress, so comments, issues, feedback and feature requests should all be included in the <a href='https://github.com/timols/fourmer'>repository</a>. I'll start on adding documentation shortly.</p>
