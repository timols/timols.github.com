title: A simple way to track your macbook using the isight

<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p class='no-indent'>
  These instructions are for how to implement a simple laptop tracking script
  on any Mac laptop. With OS X > 10.5.
  All of the files for this can be found in the following <a
  href="https://github.com/timols/laptoptracker">github repository</a>.
  Download the following:
</p>

<ol class="digits">
  <li>Get <a href="http://www.intergalactic.de/pages/iSight.html">isight capture</a></li>
  <li class="last">Get <a href="http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/">sleepwatcher</a></li>
</ol>

<p class='no-indent'>
  Download isightcapture and mount the image once the download is complete.
  Copy the ‘isightcapture’ executable to either /usr/sbin or /bin/ (I placed
  it into /bin). Download sleepwatcher to your Desktop and extract the archive.
  After it’s extracted, fire up terminal.app and enter the following:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}

  $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/share/man/man8
  $ sudo cp ~/Desktop/sleepwatcher_2.1.1/sleepwatcher /usr/local/sbin
  $ sudo cp ~/Desktop/sleepwatcher_2.1.1/sleepwatcher.8 /usr/local/share/man/man8

{% endhighlight %}

  You'll then need to add a bash script to be executed when your laptop wakes.
  You'll want to save this file as <code>/etc/rc.wakeup</code>. You can use
  the following replacing the relevant parts:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}

  #! /bin/sh

  date=$(date +%d%m%y%H%M%S).jpg;

  sleep 5;

  /bin/isightcapture -w 640 -h 480 -t jpg /Users/USERNAME/Photos/$date;

  sleep 60;

  cur_status=`ifconfig en0 | grep -o '[a-z]*active'`;
  cur_user=`id -un`;
  cur_host=`scutil --get LocalHostName`;

  if [ $cur_status == 'active' ]; then
      ip_string=`python /Users/USERNAME/Documents/get_geoip_data.py`
  else
      ip_string="connection inactive";
  fi

  ip_log_string="$(date +%d/%m/%y' '%H:%M:%S), ${cur_host}, ${cur_user}, ${ip_string}";

  echo $ip_log_string >> /Users/USERNAME/Photos/IPLog.txt;

{% endhighlight %}

<p class='no-indent'>
  Don't forget to make sure that the rc.wakeup file has the appropriate read/write
  attributes. Once you've saved it in the appropriate directory, enter terminal,
  navigate to the directory the script is saved in and enter the following command:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}

   $ sudo chmod 755 rc.wakeup

{% endhighlight %}

<p class='no-indent'>
  You'll notice that the ip is obtained by the 'get_geoip_data' python script.
  Create a file in the directory specified in the bash script, with the filename
  get_geoip_data.py and fill it with:
</p>

{% highlight python %}

  from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
  from urllib2 import urlopen

  def get_geoip_data():
      result = {}
      url_string = "http://www.maxmind.com/app/locate_my_ip"
      res = urlopen(url_string)
      html = res.read()
      soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
      keys = soup.findAll(attrs={'class' : 'tblProduct1'})
      values = soup.findAll(attrs={'class' : 'output'})
      for i in range(0, len(keys)):
          result[keys[i].contents[0].strip()] = values[i].contents[0].strip()
      return result

  def format_result():
      output = get_geoip_data()
      lat_lon = output['Latitude/Longitude'].split('/')
      ip = output['Your IP Address']
      print "%s, %s, %s" % (ip, lat_lon[0], lat_lon[1])

  format_result()

{% endhighlight %}

<p class='no-indent'>
  In order to use this script, you'll need to have the Beautiful Soup python package
  installed. If you have easy_install, you can install it with
  <code>easy_install BeautifulSoup</code>, or you can install it from source
  by going to the <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">website</a>
</p>

<p class='no-indent'>
  Finally, you need to set up the configuration file that is going to be handled
  by the LaunchDaemon. Create a file called sleepwatcher.plist and fill it with
  the following:
</p>

{% highlight xml %}

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
                            "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
  <plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>capture_onstartup</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
      <string>/usr/local/sbin/sleepwatcher</string>
      <string>-V</string>
      <string>-w /etc/rc.wakeup</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
  </plist>

{% endhighlight %}

<p class='no-indent'>
  You'll then need to copy the configuration file to <code>/Library/LaunchDaemons/</code> and enable the LaunchDaemon
  by entering the following command:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}

   $ launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/sleepwatcher.plist

{% endhighlight %}

<p class='no-indent'>
  You should now be good to test that everything is working by closing the lid on
  your laptop and then reopening it. You should find a photo of your face in your
  photos directory. To make sure that you get the most value out of it make sure
  to use it with Dropbox and ensure your photos directory is being synced or
  alternatively, change the relevant directories in the bash script for the
  appropriate directory in your Dropbox folder.
</p>

<p class='no-indent'>
  For additional fun, you can sync these photos with your Facebook, Flickr or
  Picassa albums through their REST APIs, or use a different cloud storage
  solution so you can see who is using your device.
