<p class="no-indent">Its been a very long while since I last wrote on this blog. I've been focused on multiple side projects, adjusting after Topguest was acquired, and just generally enjoying a few new activities.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Now that things have settled somewhat, I thought I'd take the opportunity to move my custom built website from Google App Engine (yes, I built it by hand using App Engine instead of using Wordpress or another blogging site) to Github Pages with Jekyll.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Putting together a static website with Jekyll was so straightforward, that it took almost no time at all. As a result, I thought I'd share some of the things I learnt in the migration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Find another website that is built using Jekyll and hosted on github pages (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com" target="_blank">Tom Preston-Warner's website is a good one</a>) as a starting point.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use Pygments if you plan on including code snippets. It makes life so simple.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/yaml-front-matter">YAML Front matter!</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Spend less time configuring with sites like Wordpress, Blogger etc!
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="no-indent">
Now that the process for writing new blog posts is simply a matter of opening my text editor (SublimeText 2), writing comfortably, then doing a good old <code>git push</code>, I'm hoping to write a lot more frequently now.
